<h1 class="first">DANCER POSE </h1>
<h3 class="second"><marquee>"Yoga's most advanced postures often require putting together a combination of difficult skills. King Dancer Pose (Natarajasana) requires strong balance, intense backbending, and open shoulders, all of which take time to cultivate."</marquee></h3>

<h3 class="third"> Steps to perform Dancer Pose</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Shift your weight onto the right foot. Bend your left knee to lift your left foot off the floor. Keep your left knee hugging toward your midline throughout this pose.</li>
<li>Grasp the instep of your left foot with your left hand. Your thumb is resting on the sole of your foot and pointing in the direction of your toes.</li>
<li>Lift your right arm straight up to the ceiling. </li>
<li>Lift your left leg behind you as you bring your torso forward as a counterbalance. Remember that your left knee should not splay out to the side. </li>
<li>Your right arm will also move forward.</li>
<li>Kick your left foot strongly into your left hand to lift the leg higher and deepen the backbend. Keep your left toes active.</li>
<li>Fix your gaze (Drishti) on something that doesn't move so that you donâ€™t lose the balance.</li>
<li>Hold 5 to 10 breaths.</li>
<li>Keep kicking your left foot into your left hand to rise back up. Lower your left leg back in line with your right. Repeat the pose on the other side.
</li>

</ul>
